Hey, all. I'm a master's Cybersecurity student with a bachelor's in Music.
I'm still in my intro/catch-up courses since my bachelor's is not tech oriented.
A friend has recommended I try to learn some things on my own through picoCTF.
After he walked me through a few simpler ones, I'm on a missions to learn as much as I can about Linux and CTF-style environments/tasks. 
This page will serve as my catalog of things I've done and succeeded/failed/tried again.
Any helpful tips are always welcomed :)
